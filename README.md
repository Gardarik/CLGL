CLGL - Implementing software rasterisation using OpenCL.

This is merely a collection of source code samples from my project. To run you need a Microsoft Visual Studio Solution (or analogue) linked with the
unofficial OpenGL SDK and your GPU vendor's OpenCL implementation. I highly recommend using Premake (just google it) to generate one: it saved me a 
lot of trouble with linking errors.
